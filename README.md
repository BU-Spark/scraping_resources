## Scraping Resources

This is an evolving, non-exhaustive list of resources presented to the students at
Boston University's CS 506 class on Wednesday 10/7/2020.

Scrapers are in the `scrapers` directory. It is worth noting that these scrapers
were built by me as a student for my use and will likely require some modifications
before you can use them in your own project. 

Lecture slides are in the references directory.
